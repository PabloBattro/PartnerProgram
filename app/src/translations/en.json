    "stage1Desc": "Understand which products sell, how to price them, and where the real demand is — before you invest.",
    "stage1Pain": "Public data is scarce, local consumer behavior is opaque, and mispricing kills margins from day one",

    "stage5Pain": "VAT and invoicing rules change frequently; non-compliance triggers fines, import blocks, or account suspension",
    "stage5Solution": "Tax and compliance partners keep your filings current and flag regulatory changes before they become problems",
